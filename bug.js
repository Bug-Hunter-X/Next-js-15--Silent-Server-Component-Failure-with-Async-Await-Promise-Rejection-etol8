In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with `async/await` and encountering an unexpected rejection within a promise.  The error might not be immediately obvious because it doesn't always manifest as a clear-cut error message in the browser console. Instead, the server component might appear to hang or silently fail, producing no visible output or a partial rendering.  This can be particularly insidious when dealing with external API calls within the server component. For example, if an API call rejects due to a network issue, the server component might not correctly handle the rejection, leading to this silent failure.  The exact behavior will depend on how error handling is implemented in the server component.  This is often challenging to debug because the error is happening on the server, not directly within the client-side JavaScript.
