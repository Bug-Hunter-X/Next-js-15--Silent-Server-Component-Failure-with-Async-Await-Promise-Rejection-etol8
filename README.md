# Next.js 15: Silent Server Component Failure with Async/Await

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 related to server components, `async/await`, and unhandled promise rejections.  The issue results in a silent failure where the server component doesn't throw an error but also doesn't produce the expected output.

## Bug Description
When using `async/await` within a Next.js 15 server component, an unexpected promise rejection can lead to a silent failure. This is often difficult to debug, as there's no clear error message in the console. The server component might appear to hang or simply not render any output.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the server component (see `bug.js` for the problematic code).

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that includes robust error handling to address the silent failure. This involves utilizing a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle any exceptions that occur within the async operation. The solution also logs errors to the console for easier debugging.
